# Assignment 2

This project contains implementations for various interpolation methods including Neville's method, Newton's forward method, Hermite interpolation, and cubic spline interpolation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Running the Code

To execute the script and see the results of the interpolation methods, run:

"""bash
python src/main/assignment_2.py
"""

## Results

The script will output the results for each interpolation method. For example, for Neville's method, you should see:
